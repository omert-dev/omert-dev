# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  

I'm Omer, a CS junior at **UT Dallas**.  

I love turning designs into lightning-fast, accessible interfaces that feel effortless.  

Outside of code and Figma, you'll find me in the gym, playing soccer, or watching Netflix.  
I also enjoy exploring new tech trends, experimenting with side projects, and finding creative ways to blend design with functionality.
